It is an informed search algorithm that computes
\textbf{paths of minimal cost}, based on 
the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item $g$: Represents the \textbf{accumulated cost} from
the initial node to the current node $v$.
\item $\hat{h}$: Is an \textbf{estimate of the cost} from
the current node $v$ to the goal.
\item $\hat{f} = g + \hat{h}$: Is an estimate of the cost from
the initial node to the goal, having $v$ in the path.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
This algorithm works in a \textbf{greedy fashion},
expanding the next unexplored  node with the smallest
estimated cost $\hat{f}$ at the moment. 
This procedure is repeated until the goal is reached.
