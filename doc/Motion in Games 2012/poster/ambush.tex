\begin{itemize}

\item A$^*$mbush is an $A^*$-based algorithm that solves the
ambush generation problem. 

\item It consists of a \textbf{modification} of the $g$ function,
that favours path diversity. We will call this function $g'$.

\item Let $\Psi(v,i) = 1+(\# j : j \in A \wedge v \in path(j))$,
be the number of agents different from agent $i$, that have the 
node $v$ in their paths towards $t$ plus one.

\item $g'(pos(i),i) = 0$ for the initial node.

\item $g'(w, i) = g'(v,i) + \lambda_i(<v,w>) \cdot \Psi(w,i)^2$
for every expanded edge $<v,w>$.

\item The properties of $A^*$ are preserved. Nevertheless, the path
\textbf{might not be optimal} for the original costs function $g$.
