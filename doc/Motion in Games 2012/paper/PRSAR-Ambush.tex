\begin{abstract}
In the area of Artificial Intelligence for Videogames,
A* is a commonly proposed algorithm  for path-finding. 
Even though this algorithm guaranties optimality, it tends
to bring forth similar behaviours in agents that are
close to each other. On the other hand, when the agents
are sparsely distributed, the algorithm doesn’t secure an
attack that comes from different places. Having the
generation of ambush behaviours and diversity of paths
as the goal, A*mbush, P-A*mbush, R-A*mbush and SAR-A*mbush
are proposed. 
They are modification of A* that considers
the amount of agents that have a specific node
(or edge) in their calculated path, when it’s
computing the cost function of that point in
the graph. P-A*mbush, R-A*mbush and SAR-A*mbush
are variations of A*mbush which tries to improve
the paths generated by the proposed A*mbush algorithm.
