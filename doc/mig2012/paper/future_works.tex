\section{Future Works}


Given the nature of the algorithm, it is possible for agents to
take paths that are long at some points when it is not needed. 
The possibility of a selective incorporation of the algorithm will
be explored. This strategy would have the goal of making the
 incremental distance as minimal as possible.

Likewise, the inclusion of a maximum capacity for nodes or edges
will be studied. This variation corresponds to the problem proposed in
\cite{art3}, when all the edges have an unitary capacity. 

Additionally, an heuristic will be implemented to restrict the 
ambush behaviour to a radius around the goal. This way, 
both path and computational costs could be reduced. 
This heuristic can also be adapted to generate several levels
of game difficulty.
