\section*{SAR-A*mbush}

\begin{itemize}
\item Using the same distance R for the fixed radius in
different maps, would produce good results in some of them
and bad ones in others. This means the user would have to
\textbf{manually fix} the measure of R.

\item We propose SAR-A$^∗$mbush as a variation of
R-A$^∗$ambush.

\item Initially, this method makes each agent calculate the
path with A$^∗$. Then, a \textbf{set of points} from that route is chosen.
This will be the set of the possible radius R.

\item The algorithm will select the \textbf{minimum radius} that
generates the \textbf{greatest} $\Phi$, starting
from the smallest R.

\item In case of a \textbf{tie in the maximum ambush} value, it would go
for the path that achieves the \textbf{best distribution} of the agents.
