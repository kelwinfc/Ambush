\section*{\large{Motivation}}
\begin{large}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generating agents with \textbf{intelligent-looking} behaviors
has been a constant challenge in the area of Artificial
Intelligence for video games. The user expects to see
agents that can perform \textbf{tactical movements} and
\textbf{group strategies}.

%\item These behaviors tend to be complex in their implementation
%and usually result in pre-established moves that can be easily
%identified by the user.

\item 
A situation that appears frecuently in this area 
is having a group of agennts trying to reach 
 a common target  through pathfinding.
The goal point is usually given by a location in the game map
(potentially the opponent's position).

\item A well known approach is to generate the \textbf{minimal path}
towards the objective.
When the algorithm is executed independently by multiple agents,
it is very likely for the paths to be \textbf{confluent}. Thus,
route diversity and map exploration is prevented.

\bigskip
\item When the minimal path strategy is applied for chasing
the enemy, many escape paths are left open. Therefore,
it is of special interest to generate mechanisms of \textbf{route
diversification} that can produce ambush behaviors.
